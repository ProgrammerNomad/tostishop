# Firebase Authentication Fixes v5.4.0

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Google Login Infinite Loop** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Google login was stuck in an infinite loop where it would try to login → fail → try to register → fail → try to login again.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `autoRegisterGoogleUser` function didn't have loop prevention
- When backend registration failed, it would restart the login process
- No proper attempt tracking for registration flow

**Solution**:
- Added `googleRegistrationAttempts` counter with `MAX_GOOGLE_REGISTRATION_ATTEMPTS = 1`
- Enhanced loop prevention in both login and registration flows  
- Reset attempts properly on success, error, and cancellation
- Added intelligent fallback: if registration fails due to "email_exists", try login once more

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Added registration attempt tracking
let googleRegistrationAttempts = 0;
const MAX_GOOGLE_REGISTRATION_ATTEMPTS = 1;

// Enhanced autoRegisterGoogleUser with loop prevention
if (googleRegistrationAttempts >= MAX_GOOGLE_REGISTRATION_ATTEMPTS) {
    // Stop the loop and show error
    return;
}
```

### 2. **Email Authentication Complete** ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: Email login and registration needed to be fully functional with Firebase Auth + WordPress integration.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Email Login**: Uses `auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword()` → `loginToWordPress(user, 'email')`
- ✅ **Email Registration**: Uses `auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` → Shows modal for name collection → Creates WordPress account
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for all Firebase auth errors
- ✅ **UX Improvements**: Helpful hints when email already exists, password validation, etc.

**Flow**:
1. **Login**: Email + Password → Firebase Auth → WordPress Login
2. **Register**: Email + Password → Firebase Auth → Modal for Name → WordPress Account Creation

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements** ✅ ENHANCED
- **Auto-suggestion**: If email already exists during registration, suggests switching to login
- **Better Loading States**: Clear feedback during authentication
- **Error Recovery**: Reset forms and focus appropriate fields on errors
- **Smart Redirects**: Proper redirect URLs after successful auth
