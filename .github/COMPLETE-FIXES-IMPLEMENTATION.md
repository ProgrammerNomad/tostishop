## Bug Fixes Implemented

### 1. Product Variation Image Changes ✅

**Problem**: Product images weren't changing when variations (color, size) were selected.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced JavaScript variation handling in `assets/js/theme.js`
- Improved image transition effects with fade animations
- Better thumbnail state management
- Fixed reset functionality to restore original images

**Key Features**:
- Smooth fade transitions between variation images
- Thumbnail updates to reflect selected variation
- Proper image restoration when variation is reset
- Console logging for debugging

### 2. Desktop Width Improvements ✅

**Problem**: Account pages, cart, and checkout had limited width on desktop.

**Solution**:
- Updated `woocommerce/myaccount/my-account.php` with wider containers:
  - `max-w-7xl xl:max-w-[95rem] 2xl:max-w-[110rem]`
- Updated `woocommerce/cart/cart.php` with matching wide containers
- Added responsive padding improvements
- Enhanced grid layout for better space utilization

**New Layout Widths**:
- Desktop (1280px+): 95rem max-width
- Large Desktop (1536px+): 110rem max-width
- Maintained mobile responsiveness

### 3. Navigation Visibility Desktop Fix ✅

**Problem**: Account navigation menu was hidden on desktop.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `woocommerce/myaccount/navigation.php` with proper Alpine.js directives
- Added CSS overrides in `assets/css/custom.css` to force visibility
- Enhanced navigation styling for desktop
- Added hover effects and active states

**CSS Enhancements**:
```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .woocommerce-MyAccount-navigation {
        display: block !important;
    }
    
    .woocommerce-MyAccount-navigation-list {
        display: block !important;
    }
    
    .account-nav-link {
        display: flex !important;
    }
}
```

### 4. Product Added to Cart Notifications ✅

**Problem**: No user feedback when products were added to cart.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced existing notification system in `assets/js/notifications.js`
- Integrated with both manual AJAX and WooCommerce events
- Added cart-specific notifications with action buttons
- Styled with brand colors and smooth animations

**Features**:
- "View Cart" and "Continue Shopping" action buttons
- Auto-dismiss after 6 seconds
- Smooth slide-in animations
- Brand-consistent styling

### 5. Select Options for Variations ✅

**Problem**: Need to restore select dropdowns for variations.

**Solution**:
- Modified `woocommerce/single-product.php` with intelligent detection
- Color attributes show as visual swatches (≤8 options)
- Non-color attributes use select dropdowns
- Enhanced color swatch styling with CSS

**Smart Logic**:
- Detects color attributes by name (`color`, `colour`)
- Shows swatches for colors, dropdowns for other attributes
- Maps common color names to hex values
- Proper accessibility with labels and titles
